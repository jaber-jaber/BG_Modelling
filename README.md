# BG_Modelling

Basal ganglia network modelling to investigate mechanisms of DBS.

To run any simulations, NMODL files must be compiled first.

To compile, run:
```
nrnivmodl
```
in a terminal within the directory containing all .mod files. If you want to compile specific files, you can run:

```
nrnivmodl sample.mod
```
